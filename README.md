## Introduction


## User Experience (UX)


## Initial Discussion
[Happy Sauna was created with a simple goal: to help people relax and enjoy the health benefits of sauna sessions. We noticed that everyone seems to be busy these days, and finding time to unwind is hard. That's why we made a website where people can learn about our saunas, see the prices, and book a session easily.

We built this site for anyone who wants to take a break from their busy life and look after their health. Whether you're new to saunas or you've been enjoying them for years, we want to make it simple for you to find the information you need and get started with us.

Our website is designed to be easy to use. We chose colors and pictures that make you feel calm and peaceful, just like our saunas. We also made sure you can find your way around the site without any hassle.]
